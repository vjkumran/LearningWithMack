With Learning with Mack you can teach kids their ABC's and Learning with Mack helps you pronunciate the letters. You can use Learning with Mack internationally to help someone studying the English language.

You'll like Learning with Mack because you can also play a little word game to test your memory.  The word game starts off with a simple match the word with the picture.  More levels with be coming soon in an update.  Try to beat your highest score as you keep track of your points.  

One day I was listening to my brother practice his ABCs.  I tried to download the app they told his to use for the class but the UI was not friendly.  We were not able to start of at the letter A which was weird.  Instead, I made Learning with Mack named after my brother to help other kids with learning the Alphabet.  As an extention i threw the little word game at the end. This is my first project and dedicated to my brother.
